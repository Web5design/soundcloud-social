SoundCloud Social

Play tracks from soundcloud collaboratively and chat about them. Heavily inspired by http://www.youtubesocial.com
The track is started synchronously. All participants always hear the same position of the song. Everyone can chat with each other while the track plays.

Used to build this:
SoundCloud Javascript Widget Player
Rails 3
Socky

How to run:

1) Make sure that config.yml and config/socky_hosts.yml point to your server (if in development then localhost)

2) start rails with 'rails server'

3) start socky websockets server with 'socky -c config.yml'

This hack was build by Johan after an idea by Nils at the Music Hack Day Barcelona 2010.
